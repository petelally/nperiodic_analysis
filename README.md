# Scripts used to reconstruct & fit T2* maps from N-periodic SSFP data
MATLAB scripts and .dat files used to generate T2* maps from raw data.
This is accompanies the paper 'SSFP as an alternative to multi-echo gradient echo' authored by Lally PJ, Jin Y, Huo Z, Beitone C, Chiew M, Matthews PM, Miller KL and Bangerter NK.

It also includes existing software from other groups (in the 'external' folder): 
- Philip Ehses' mapVBVD library (https://github.com/pehses/mapVBVD) for reading in .dat files
- some helper functions (sos, fft2c, ifft2c) from the ESPIRiT toolbox (https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~mlustig/Software.html)
